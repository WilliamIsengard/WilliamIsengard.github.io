				<h3>Passion Project</h3>
					<p><strong>Project Description: </strong>I envision a platform for local artists of all types and skills (old, young, professional, amateur, painter, photograper, baker, knitter, etc.) to display their art work online to reach their community. It will be limited to the local area (i.e. 100 mile radius?) to encourage supporting the local art scene. It will provide a way for local artists to make money and share their creations/skills. It will be free for the artists to display their work and the site will generate revenue via ads that artists can opt into. It will differ from Etsy and other art sites by the local emphasis and free hosting and have a look similar to Pintrist.</p>
					<p><strong>Elevator Pitch:</strong> Hi my name is Billy. I am building a platform to enable artists and artisans to showcase their creations. Unlike Etsy and similar sites, the end users will be exposed to only products and services in their current geographic area to encourage their support of the local art community. Tourists and other visitors will be able to gain exposure to new art communities during their travels. I'm doing this partnership with Meow Wolf and CNM and coding it with Javascript. Does your organization engage with the local art community currently?</p>

						<p><strong>Reflections: </strong>This activity showed I do not have much online presense currently. My last name is associated with Lord of the Rings so most search results are related to that popular book/movie series. LinkedIn is the first result when searching for my name and I have it set to public so employers can view my work history and accomplishments. My personal social media sites (primarily Facebook) are set to private so very little is visible. I need to improve on my online brand to improve my employment prospects. My personal website project will be a portfolio site and I will work on emphasing SEO to ensure high page ranking. I will also improve my GitHub site and set up a Stack Overflow site.</p>
				<h3>Visuals Speak Activity</h3>

						<p>I chose an image of a business person struggling to climb a wall to represent my feelings towards my career up to this point. I have spent many years in sales roles that have left me feeling emotionally drained and unfullfilled. My business management experience has been rewarding, but it took a high toll on my family life and generated too much stress for someone else's gain.</p>
					<img src="WilliamIsengard.github.io/careerBliss.jpg" width="137" height="98" alt="Career Bliss"/>
						<p>I chose an image of a picturesque scene with three trees together in an open and peaceful location to symbolize my goal for three years into the future. The three trees represent my wife, son, and I enjoying a fulfilling life together. I hope programming provides a career that is emotionally and financially rewarding and gives a feeling of career bliss.</p>
			<h2>Weekly Activities</h2>
				<h3>Week 1 Summary</h3>
					<p>Weeky 1 was an exciting and challenging first step into my coding career. We began the week familiarizing with the proper lexicon and toolchain that will be used. We proceeded to discuss and practice HTML, Javascript, CSS, and MySQL databases. The Snap Challenges tested our knowledge and I found myself overcomplicating the first exercise. We also began our Personal Web Project and Data Design Project. I am feeling pretty confident at this stage, but there have definitely been challenges. I enjoyed the monthly tech update at Fatpipe and will continue to attend in the future. It provides a great way to be exposed to local companies and network with other folks in the industry. I also met with my career buddy Adrian and we discussed our goals and ideas for after we graduate.</p>
									<h3>Week 2 Summary</h3>
					<p>Week 2 has been  a challenging, but rewarding experience. The Snap Challenges forced me to dive deepr into Javascript, but I am feeling more confident each time. The Object Oriented Programming project has been incredibly difficult and took quite a bit of time to sort out the exceptions, but I successfully completed the first phase. The app challenge was really interesting to see and gave some insight on the quality of programs that can be created via the bootcamp as well as how to present your creations. I was impressed by the charity app and the foodtruck app in particular. The ad platform from Sandia was impressive, but it would be easy for Facebook and Google to offer the same services down the road.</p>
