				<h3>Passion Project</h3>
					<p><strong>Project Description: </strong>I envision a platform for local artists of all types and skills (old, young, professional, amateur, painter, photograper, baker, knitter, etc.) to display their art work online to reach their community. It will be limited to the local area (i.e. 100 mile radius?) to encourage supporting the local art scene. It will provide a way for local artists to make money and share their creations/skills. It will be free for the artists to display their work and the site will generate revenue via ads that artists can opt into. It will differ from Etsy and other art sites by the local emphasis and free hosting and have a look similar to Pintrist.</p>
					<p><strong>Elevator Pitch:</strong> Hi my name is Billy. I am building a platform to enable artists and artisans to showcase their creations. Unlike Etsy and similar sites, the end users will be exposed to only products and services in their current geographic area to encourage their support of the local art community. Tourists and other visitors will be able to gain exposure to new art communities during their travels. I'm doing this partnership with Meow Wolf and CNM and coding it with Javascript. Does your organization engage with the local art community currently?</p>

			<h2>Weekly Activities</h2>
				<h3>Week 1 Summary</h3>
					<p>Weeky 1 was an exciting and challenging first step into my coding career. We began the week familiarizing with the proper lexicon and toolchain that will be used. We proceeded to discuss and practice HTML, Javascript, CSS, and MySQL databases. The Snap Challenges tested our knowledge and I found myself overcomplicating the first exercise. We also began our Personal Web Project and Data Design Project. I am feeling pretty confident at this stage, but there have definitely been challenges. I enjoyed the monthly tech update at Fatpipe and will continue to attend in the future. It provides a great way to be exposed to local companies and network with other folks in the industry. I also met with my career buddy Adrian and we discussed our goals and ideas for after we graduate.</p>
									<h3>Week 2 Summary</h3>
					<p>Week 2 has been  a challenging, but rewarding experience. The Snap Challenges forced me to dive deepr into Javascript, but I am feeling more confident each time. The Object Oriented Programming project has been incredibly difficult and took quite a bit of time to sort out the exceptions, but I successfully completed the first phase. The app challenge was really interesting to see and gave some insight on the quality of programs that can be created via the bootcamp as well as how to present your creations. I was impressed by the charity app and the foodtruck app in particular. The ad platform from Sandia was impressive, but it would be easy for Facebook and Google to offer the same services down the road.</p>
