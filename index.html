	<h3>Passion Project</h3>
	<p><strong>Project Description: </strong>I envision a platform for local artists of all types and skills (old, young, professional, amateur, painter, photograper, baker, knitter, etc.) to display their art work online to reach their community. It will be limited to the local area (i.e. 100 mile radius?) to encourage supporting the local art scene. It will provide a way for local artists to make money and share their creations/skills. It will be free for the artists to display their work and the site will generate revenue via ads that artists can opt into. It will differ from Etsy and other art sites by the local emphasis and free hosting and have a look similar to Pintrist.</p>
	<p><strong>Elevator Pitch:</strong> Hi my name is Billy. I am building a platform to enable artists and artisans to showcase their creations. Unlike Etsy and similar sites, the end users will be exposed to only products and services in their current geographic area to encourage their support of the local art community. Tourists and other visitors will be able to gain exposure to new art communities during their travels. I'm doing this partnership with Meow Wolf and CNM and coding it with Javascript. Does your organization engage with the local art community currently?</p>

	<p><strong>Reflections: </strong>This activity showed I do not have much online presense currently. My last name is associated with Lord of the Rings so most search results are related to that popular book/movie series. LinkedIn is the first result when searching for my name and I have it set to public so employers can view my work history and accomplishments. My personal social media sites (primarily Facebook) are set to private so very little is visible. I need to improve on my online brand to improve my employment prospects. My personal website project will be a portfolio site and I will work on emphasing SEO to ensure high page ranking. I will also improve my GitHub site and set up a Stack Overflow site.</p>
	<h3>Visuals Speak Activity</h3>
	<img src="WilliamIsengard.github.io/uphillBattle.jpg" width="270" height="428" alt="Uphill Battle" />
	<p><strong>Present: </strong>I chose an image of a business person struggling to climb a wall to represent my feelings towards my career up to this point. I have spent many years in sales roles that have left me feeling emotionally drained and unfullfilled. My business management experience has been rewarding, but it took a high toll on my family life and generated too much stress for someone else's gain.</p>
	<img src="WilliamIsengard.github.io/careerBliss.jpg" width="274" height="196" alt="Career Bliss" />
	<p><strong>3-Year Projection: </strong>I chose an image of a picturesque scene with three trees together in an open and peaceful location to symbolize my goal for three years into the future. The three trees represent my wife, son, and I enjoying a fulfilling life together. I hope programming provides a career that is emotionally and financially rewarding and gives a feeling of career bliss.</p>

	<h3>Identify Two Orgs Activity</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Name of Org: </strong>Watermelon Mountain Ranch</li>
		<li><strong>Targeted Contact- </strong>Sara Heffern (Executive Director)</li>
		<li><strong>Contact Information- </strong>505-507-7081</li>
		<li><strong>Website- </strong>https://www.wmranch.org/</li>
		<li><strong>Why This Org: </strong>Watermelon Mountain Ranch is the largest no-kill animal shelter in NM and I strongly support their mission to help animals in need. Their customer-facing website is fairly modern, but I see an opportunity to help them address some of their logistics challenges and internal processes with web solutions.
		<li><strong>Strategy For Contact- </strong>I previously coordinated with Sara to raise funds for her organization so it will not be a cold call. I can reach out via phone, Facebook, or LinkedIn and request a face to face meeting to discuss their current needs and pain points.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Name of Org: </strong>Cultivate Coders</li>
	<li><strong>Targeted Contact- </strong>Charles Ashley III (President/Founder)</li>
	<li><strong>Contact Information- </strong>cashley@cultivatecoders.com</li>
	<li><strong>Website- </strong>https://cultivatecoders.com/</li>
	<li><strong>Why This Org: </strong>Cultivate Coders, a for-profit company with a non-profit division, offers coding bootcamps to kids and offers their coding services to the community. I respect the mission of the company and would like to help if at all possible. It would be great to work with them on their development projects as well as in a classroom setting.
	<li><strong>Strategy For Contact- </strong>I had a nice talk with Charles after his Pro Dev presentation a few weeks back and we agreed to continue discussions about potential opportunities. I intend to email him, per his request, to set up a coffee meeting.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Salary Expectations and Potential Activity</h3>
	<p>My main focus post bootcamp is to find an opportunity to work for a local company that will allow me to continue to learn to code. I am less concerned about how much I will make on day 1 because I see the huge longterm potential once I become a skilled developer. I would like to make $45k+/- per year as a junior developer if at all possible, but I will not pass up a great opportunity that pays less. Within a few years I would like to be making $55k-$60k per year.</p>
	<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
	<h3>Week 1 Summary</h3>
	<p>Weeky 1 was an exciting and challenging first step into my coding career. We began the week familiarizing with the proper lexicon and toolchain that will be used. We proceeded to discuss and practice HTML, Javascript, CSS, and MySQL databases. The Snap Challenges tested our knowledge and I found myself overcomplicating the first exercise. We also began our Personal Web Project and Data Design Project. I am feeling pretty confident at this stage, but there have definitely been challenges. I enjoyed the monthly tech update at Fatpipe and will continue to attend in the future. It provides a great way to be exposed to local companies and network with other folks in the industry. I also met with my career buddy Adrian and
		we discussed our goals and ideas for after we graduate.</p>
	<h3>Week 2 Summary</h3>
	<p>Week 2 has been a challenging, but rewarding experience. The Snap Challenges forced me to dive deepr into Javascript, but I am feeling more confident each time. The Object Oriented Programming project has been incredibly difficult and took quite a bit of time to sort out the exceptions, but I successfully completed the first phase. The app challenge was really interesting to see and gave some insight on the quality of programs that can be created via the bootcamp as well as how to present your creations. I was impressed by the charity app and the foodtruck app in particular. The ad platform from Sandia was impressive, but it would be easy for Facebook and Google to offer the same services down the road.</p>
	<h3>Week 3 Summary</h3>
	<p>Week 3 has been a very successful and stimulating period. I really enjoy CSS and look forward to learning as much as I can about it. We voted on our capstone projects and I am excited to be given the opportunity to work on my idea for a local art platform. My teammates Will and Brandon are very knowledgeable and I am excited to work with them and learn from them! Our project is going to turn out awesome and I can't wait to showcase it to the class and industry peers. There is huge 	potential to continue the project after the class ends as a non-profit entity.</p>
	<h3>Week 4 Summary</h3>
	<p>It is hard to believe we are 40% done with the bootcamp already, but the list of new skills I have developed surprises me. I enjoyed learning Bootstrap this week and it feels like a game-changer for styling a site. It was humbling to see George's solutions for the CSS activity because he accomplished the same result, if not better, than my solution in 1/5 the amount of lines of code. I had breakfast and lunch multiple times with my capstone team as well as going to my teammate 	Brandon's house to collaborate on our project. The database setup, particularly the unit testing, is a challenge, but it will set the right foundation for our project to be successful. I endorsed several classmates' skills on LinkedIn and continue to expand my network. I updated my resume based on Dan's feedback. The pro dev guest speakers on Friday were amazing, particularly the inspiring Chales Ashley who I intend to network extensively with. It has been a good week and I look forward to continuing the capstone project.</p>
	<p>The <strong>Forbidden Island</strong> board game was a great team activity! Brandon, Will, and I managed to win the game as the water levels got perilously high and the land mass was tiny. We worked very well together and communicated our thoughts effectively throughout the game. It reinforced my awareness of my questionable verbal communication skills as I struggled to express my thoughts, but my team was patient with me and it worked out well. I realize I need to practice my team communication to ensure optimal cooperation. I am a much better written communicator than verbal and will voice my ideas via Slack if all else fails.</p>
	<h3>Week 5 Summary</h3>
	<p>It is amazing to consider we are halfway done with the bootcamp already. Most of the week was focused on the capstone project, specifically unit testing. I am enjoying MySQL and PHP and I'm gaining a better understanding of these tools. I had some challenges getting the unit testing working properly, but I was able to code the tests for our Profile class and get everything working. I spent a late night Friday getting another two classes to pass their tests cleanly. We need to add some additional tests to those classes and get the final class cleaned up and working correctly. My team and I are meeting Sunday to continue working on our project. We are very excited for the potential for this project and we work great together. I received feedback on my wireframes for the PWP and everything is looking good so far. I will be working hard on that project this weekend as well. It was a good week and I am proud of what we have accomplished.</p>
	<h3>Week 6 Summary</h3>
	<p>Week 6 was phenomenal! I am proud of myself for overcoming some challenges with some changes my team had to make on our database class methods and unit texts. Several late nights led to a breakthrough in my understanding of PHP. I have also made some solid strides in Javascript and I'm making good progress on my PWP site. I enjoyed attending 1 Million Cups and networking with local business professionals. I have a difficult time in large group settings like that, but I pushed myself to talk to some great folks. I introduced myself to John Mierzwa and Lisa J. Adkins, CEO and COO respectively of Ingenuity Software Labs. They seem like great resources within the local coding community and I plan on meeting with them to discuss career pathways and opportunities in the next few weeks. Their presentation on Friday provided additional insights into their company and reinforced the need to improve my online presence. I also spoke with Brian Stinar, cofounder of Noventum, about his company and the solar industry. I made introductions to several other people at the event and I intend on going to future sessions.</p>
	<h3>Week 7 Summary</h3>
	<p>Week 7 was very productive. I completed my PWP site after addressing some visual issues. I am happy with the final product, though I will continue to update the site and add projects to my portfolio as I complete them. My capstone team and I are making solid progress on the API testing. We completed the majority of APIs and the remaining few should not pose too much of an issue. Once we got the hang of the XSRF and JWT tokens, the testing and debugging went pretty smoothly. We should have API testing fully completed by Monday or Tuesday and move on to the front-end development for our project. The field trip to Oso Grande was awesome and I loved learning about the data visualization work being done by RS21. They are definitely a company I would be proud to work for if given the opportunity!</p>
	<h3>Week 8 Summary</h3>
	<p>Week 8 was an exciting and scary time. We got a great deal of work done on our APIs and finished most of the static UI for the front end. I am excited to implement Angular this week and see our site come to life. I prepared as much as I could for the mock technical interview, but I was still nervous. I felt prepared for the HR interview so I wasn't too nervous for that. I had a phone interview with RSI Wednesday and it went really well. I have an in-person HR/tech interview on the 13th as well, which is very exciting! The mock interviews on Friday went well and I felt the tech interview was not as bad as I anticipated. I definitely need to practice and review for real-world tech interviews, but I am confident I can do well in the future.</p>
